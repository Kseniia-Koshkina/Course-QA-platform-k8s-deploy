### A scalable Q&A platform 

Enables users to post questions, provide answers, and upvote content anonymously. The platform integrates a large language model (LLM) API to generate answers asynchronously, ensuring a smooth user experience. Key features include sorting by recency, infinite scrolling, and automatic content updates. The project includes Docker Compose configurations for both local development and production build and includes  Kubernetes configurations for scalable deployment with monitoring via Prometheus and Grafana. Testing is done using Playwright for end-to-end tests and k6 for performance tests. The application is styled with TailwindCSS for a consistent and modern UI.

For detailed instructions on how to set up and run the application, please refer to the [RUNNING.md](https://github.com/Kseniia-Koshkina/Course-QA-platform-k8s-deploy/blob/main/RUNNING.md) file.
